# interview-platform-take-home

Notes to the team:

- Learning chart.js, flask and much more python functionaity was amazing, thanks for giving me the opportunity to work on this project.

- I am unhappy with the way my server is currently built and deployed, it needs quite a bit of refactoring to make it cleaner and more modular.

- I used 2 ways to create and interact with state, hooks and components, not sure which you prefer

- Still need refactoring on the helper functions on my frontend to make things a bit cleaner

steps to run:

1. npm install inside of the project folder
   <!-- I believe this is all you need for the python backend -->
2. pip3 install Flask
3. Navigate a terminal window to /server/routes and run python3 api.py to get the backend running
4. npm run start another terminal to get your react server running
5. Visit http://localhost:3000/ and graph away!
